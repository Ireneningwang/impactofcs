								<h4>What is Machine Learning?</h4>
								<p>Machine learning is an area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses statistical techniques to give a computer system the ability to 'learn' from data, 
								without being explicitly programmed. In terms of computer systems, the word 'learn' refers to a computer progressively improving on performance within the task 
								it is executing.</p>
								<p>Machine learning tasks are divided into several categories:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Supervised Learning:</b> Initially, inputs with known outputs are given to the system. The machine will then learn a general rule which relates the inputs to 
									the desired outputs and then use this rule for inputs which an output is to be generated.</li>
									<li><b>Semi-supervised Learning:</b> This method of learning is much like supervised learning, however the data given to the machine doesn't always have outputs 
									for the machine to map the inputs to. Therefore, there may be data given to the machine which it will have to generate the missing output for the given input, 
									using the rule it has learned from previous cases or data.</li>
									<li><b>Active Learning:</b> This type of learning is based around the machine being able to query the user or some information source to obtain desired outputs at 
									new data points.</li>
									<li><b>Unsupervised Learning:</b> In this process of learning, no labels (rules) are given to the machine initially, it is up to the machine to find structure in 
									the input given to it. This is considered rather difficult as the machine may not follow the desired learning path and is therefore considered a goal in itself.</li>
									<li><b>Reinforcement Learning:</b> This concept revolves round rewards and punishments. Data is only given as feedback to the machine to its decisions in a dynamic 
									environment, such as automated driving and playing a game against an opponent. In turn this will teach the machine what is considered good and bad.</li>

								<h4>Applications of Machine Learning in the Real World</h4>
								<p>One of the main applications of machine learning is <b>Virtual Personal Assistants (VPAs)</b>. Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Now are all examples of VPAs, their 
								purpose if the help the everyday user efficiently. For example, a person asks 'How is the weather looking today?' and the VPA will respond with the forecast 
								for the day almost instantly. Machine learning has made this possible, millions of people feeding the VPA inputs like the previous example everyday has allowed 
								the VPAs to learn the structure of various different languages and accents so that the VPA has a higher chance of understand the request (input) better. Virtual 
								Personal Assistants has and is having a positive impact on society, making the lives of people much more efficient and easier.</p>
								
								<p>Another application of machine learning is in road traffic. Specifically, <b>GPS navigation services</b>. Such services keep track of locations and velocities of vehicles.
								 The data collected from millions of vehicles is used to build a traffic map. However, there are a small percentage of cars actually equipped with a GPS and so the data obtained 
								 is not as accurate and ranged as it could be. This is where machine learning comes in. Machine learning is used to <i>estimate</i> the areas where congestion can be found 
								 on the basis of daily experiences. Like VPAs, machine learning in road traffic is used to help the everyday commuter pick the journey that takes the least time.</p>
								 
								 <p>Machine learning is also used in <b>video surveillance</b>. Machine learning is used in the area of security, as it is difficult for a single person to handle many CCTV 
								 cameras. With machine learning, the machine can help by identifying possible criminals before a crime even occurs, if the system suspects a person then the attendant is 
								 alerted, allowing the human to keep an eye on that person in particular. This is accomplished using many machine learning tasks, one being feeding the machine with footage 
								 of crimes and allowing it to use the footage to make rules or guidelines of the behaviour of criminals before they even commit a crime. Machine learning is extremely beneficial 
								 to society as it ensures the safety of the public much more than CCTV ever has before.</p>
								 
								 <p>Another growing use of machine learning is <b>automated driving</b> in cars. Tesla cars are currently the front of automated driving. A more dedicated and detailed explanation 
								 on AI in cars can be found <a href="self-driving-cars.html">here</a>. Essentially, Tesla cars in particular use machine learning to learn what to do and when. Learning is done from 
								 feedback from the user, so if the user notices a car starting to go off course ever so slightly they will correct the steering wheel to keep the car aligned within its lane, 
								 this feedback is sent back to a centralised database which will help all cars within the same scenario at the same place. In my opinion, machine learning in automated driving 
								 has a positive impact on society because it allows the driver to be more aware of what is happening around them without having to also control the vehicle. I think automated cars will 
								 evolve to the points where car accidents are much less frequent as there is no human error.</p>

<p>Let me introduce you firstly to the problem, and then to the solution to this problem.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that the road can be a dangerous place, whether you are inside or outside of a vehicle.</p>
<p>This is because human beings make mistakes, and people get hurt due to these mistakes.</p>
<p>The statistics back up these statements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In 2014 there were <b><u><i>1.25 million</i></u></b> deaths worldwide due to vehicle crashes.</li>
	<li>There were 32,675 deaths in the United States due to vehicle crashes in 2014.</li>
	<li>In 2016, there was a 6% increase in traffic fatalities, reaching the highest point in nearly a decade.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h5>In a vast majority of these incidents, there is a clear theme: human error and inattention.</h5>
<h4><b><u>94%</u></b> of crashes in the US involve human choice or error.</h4>
<br>
<p>In 2014, on roads in the US, there were:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>9,262</b> deaths due to <i>speeding</i></li>
	<li><b>9,967</b> deaths due to <i>alcohol</i></li>
	<li><b>3,179</b> deaths due to <i>distraction</i></li>
	<li><b>846</b> deaths due to <i>drowsiness</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>Recent developments in Computer Science now mean that we can offer a potential solution to this global issue of human drivers killing and injuring themselves and other people.</p>

<p>The solution that I am talking about is cars that are able to drive themselves, without a driver behind the wheel.</p>

<p>Cars are only able to do this because current technology allows them to 'see' and 'understand' their surroundings.</p>

<p>You might be wondering how we might achieve this, well, let me explain.</p>

<p>The 'seeing' part is possible due to advancements in camera and radar technology. Cameras and radar devices are fitted to the vehicle, and they provide the onboard computer with a vast amount of information constantly as it drives along.</p>

<p>However, all of this information would be useless unless the onboard computer is able to process it all in real time and provide appropriate outputs, such as changing the speed or direction of the vehicle. This is where the 'understanding' part comes in, recent developments in object recognition software and artificial intelligence have led to computers being able to process input from a camera and identify and track all of the objects in the images, for instance, the computer will be able to tell if the images are showing a pedestrian, a cyclist, or another vehicle, and even what type of vehicle it is. These object classes are then used to predict what the object in question will do next.</p>

<p>The onboard computer uses this object recognition software on the input from the camera, along with the input coming from the radar devices on the car, which allow to computer to work out precisely how far away an object is, as well as the speed at which it is approaching or receding.</p>

<p>The combination of all of these input sources allows the computer to get an idea of what is happening and, crucially, what is about to happen, meaning that the vehicle can take action to prevent an incident before it actually occurs.</p>

<p>Another advantage to driverless cars is that the onboard computer on every single vehicle is connected via a network, meaning that they can share information with each other and 'learn' from each other. Therefore, they can improve themselves automatically, whether that is in their predictions of objects, or the appropriate action to be taken in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>This feature clearly makes these driverless vehicles vastly superior, in terms of safety, to vehicles with human drivers. No human driver has the collective knowledge and experience of every other human driver in the world, but this is effectively what will be the case with driverless cars.</p>

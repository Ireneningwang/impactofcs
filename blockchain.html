<p>Jerzy Foss is a first year Durham University Computer Science student who is very experienced in web design, having worked as a freelance web developer for several years.</p>

<p>The first programming language that Jerzy ever learnt was Java, and this kickstarted his love for programming. His heavy interest in technology and property has led him to create a profit projections/deal analysis web app, along with also being the co-founder of a property company where he does profit projections, strategy and website development.</p>

<p>Jerzy has always been willing and happy to help and teach others, especially when it comes to STEM subjects, he has previously mentored GCSE students in maths and sciences, as well as teaching an A-Level class on Object Oriented Programming.</p>

<p>Even with his significant web design experience, as previosuly mentioned, he would still say that his area of expertise is actually in designing Object-Oriented REST APIs, and he is currently working on some exciting API-driven automation projects.</p>
<p>You can find some of Jerzy's work on his <a href="https://github.com/jfdur" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a> page.
<p>Or if you want to get in contact with him, you can connect with him on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jerzy-foss" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a>.
